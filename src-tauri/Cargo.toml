[lib]
# The `_lib` suffix may seem redundant but it is necessary
# to make the lib name unique and wouldn't conflict with the bin name.
# This seems to be only an issue on Windows, see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8519

# Reject corrupted or uncompliant files, even if they could be read anyway.
#
# `ErrorKind::Malformed` errors will only be raised when this feature is enabled.
strict = []

# Enable the `alloc` dependency.
#
# Disabling this feature leaves pretty much only the raw `parse` and `write` functions, but makes
# the crate fully `no_std`.
# If this feature is enabled, but the `std` feature is not, the crate becomes `no_std + alloc`.
alloc = []

# Integrate with the `std` library.
# Depends on the `alloc` feature.

# Enable multithreaded parsing.
# Depends on the `std` feature.
#
# Multithreaded parsing is automatically disabled for tiny MIDI files.
# Currently, multithreading brings in the `rayon` dependency.
